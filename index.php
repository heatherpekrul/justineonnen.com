    <p>My name is Justine Onnen and I am a Queer 22 year old undergraduate student majoring in <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/biology/undergrad/programs/fwcb/index.html">Fisheries Ecology and Management</a> at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu">Kansas State University</a>. I started my first two years at K-State in the Computer Science scholar's program before I realized it wasn't quite what I was looking for. While I loved writing code, I started to find issues with the uber competitive and often hostile environment that Computer Science lived in. When I had to take an Organismic Biology course to fulfill a general education requirement, I realized that the field of biology could offer me a much more fitting environment. The elements of collaboration along with retaining the parts of computer science that I had enjoyed was something that seemed like a dream. Now two years later I know that I could not be happier in my current career, both academically and in the lab.</p>

    <p>I have been working in the <a href="https://sulfide-life.info">Tobler Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu">Kansas State University</a> ever since I switched fields, specifically with extremophile Poecillids. By having the unique opportunity to work in a lab from the very start of my new academic path, I feel like I can comprehend my classwork in regards to both theoretical value and field application value; something that I am extremely grateful for. By having the opportunity to help with project's data, discuss scientific papers, and go into the field, I have only fallen more in love with fisheries biology as time goes on. I look forward to what more this career can teach me and show me.</p>

    <p>As for my downtime I have a few different hobbies that I love. The main two being video games (and the technology that goes along with it) and my pets. I currently have an orange dream ball python, a wild-type sand boa, and two cats that mean the world to me and keep me company when I am at home relaxing or studying. Video games and technology has always been a given for me coming from my early interest in computer science, even leading me to hold an IT Technician position for a year before switching to my current lab position. Playing Mario Kart on the N64 with my dad when I was younger is one of my best memories from my childhood, and something that I still enjoy doing.</p>

    <p>If you have any more questions about anything, may it be concerning my career or hobbies, please feel free to <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>.</p>
