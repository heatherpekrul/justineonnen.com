    <p>Activism was not something I really started worrying about until I was in high school. It was only then I realized how much our voices matter and that we have to speak up about things that we believe in and stand for. This passion only intensified when I got to college. Starting my collegiate career in a STEM field, one that is highly dominated by men, was a struggle I had not thought about when dreaming of college as a high school senior. Not only having a hard time finding peers but also being treated more harshly was something that wore on me constantly. It was discouraging to be treated as lesser than not only by fellow classmates but also by your professors. Knowing people who are in the industry, I knew that this was not a problem that stopped when you entered the workforce. Even going to career fairs and being given screening questions that you found out your male counterparts were not given.</p>

    <p>This is why I take it upon myself to help those feel like they belong in my current field; specifically women and queer people as they are my peers. I like to take part in summits, mentorships, and just general networking to help show those groups that they are not alone. One of my favorite events I got to participate in was the 2021 K-State Diversity Summit. Both speaking at it and listening to my fellow speakers was something that was very eye opening in terms of the struggles of groups that I am not a part of face in their lives.</p>

    <p>Another one of my most fufilling volunteering opportunies is working as a patient liason for women in Kansas seeking medical care. Getting to help women find help for issues such as birth control, pregnancy complication, abortion care, or moral support is something that makes me feel like I am making a positive impact. Continuing on in my life I hope to do more events and volunteering like this to help others understand what being part of these marginalized groups can be like while also continuing to educate myself.</p>
