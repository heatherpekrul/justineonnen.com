    <p>Getting ready to graduate with my undergraduate degree, I have never thought about my future more. Looking toward that future, I am hopeful to pursue my Ph.D. in marine biology or a parallel discipline. I have always had a fascination with marine life, it was always in the same category as space to me since I grew up and have lived in Kansas my whole life. Looking further my eventual end goal is to teach at a collegiate level.</p>

    <p>Currently I volunteer as a biology ambassador for K-State, and helping freshmen and incoming students with gaining their legs has been something very fulfilling to me, in a way I had not expected. Creating that spark for others and helping them gain confidence in themselves and their skills is something that I want to continue doing for the rest of my life. There is still so much that I need to figure out but I know that this is where my foundation begins.</p>

    <p>I also want to provide science communication to my community. Growing up and hearing about people killing snakes just because they can was heartbreaking and I believe a lot of that comes from not understanding their local ecosystem. The amount of times I have tried to explain why outdoor domestic cats are extremely harmful to local flora and fauna is innumerable. As I grow and develop my skills in the field and in my career, I want to work on my science communication skills just as much. I feel as if it is a responsibility of those with knowledge (to a definite certain extent) to help those who may not have the same access to information; to help their community grow.</p>
