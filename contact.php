    <h1 class="page-title">Contact Me</h1>

    <p>There are multiple ways you can contact me! The one that will have the fastest response time will probably be via email (<a href="mailto:jfonnen@ksu.edu">jfonnen@ksu.edu</a>). The other way to currently contact me would be via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justine-onnen-9aa961157/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

    <p>If you do not recieve a response in a couple days please feel free to reach out again, sometimes things get buried in my inbox! You can also <a href="cv.php">view my CV</a> which might answer any basic questions you might have!</p>
